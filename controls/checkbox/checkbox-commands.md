# Commands

RadCheckBox exposes a Commands collection that allows you to register custom commands with each controlâ€™s instance through the **Commands** property:

* **Commands**: Gets the collection with all the custom commands registered with the CommandService.

## Command Type

There are two types of commands:

* **CheckBoxCommand**: All the default commands within RadCheckBox derive from the base RadCheckBoxCommand. Think of this command as a UI-related command as it operates over the RadCheckBox instance that owns the command.
* **CheckBoxUserCommand**: This type of command should be used when you would like to modify the behavior of the control on any of the available actions. It exposes the following properties:
	* **Id**: The key that relates a command instance to a particular action/routine.
	* **Command**: Gets or sets the generic **ICommand** implementation.
	* **SuppressDefaultCommand**: Gets or sets a value indicating whether the default(built-in) UI command associated with the specified **Id** will be executed.

## Example

Here is an example how to create a **CheckBoxUserCommand**.

Add the RadCheckBox control and bound the IsCheckedChangedCommand through the CheckBoxUserCommand predefined command. Use the Id property to map the command to the corresponding action with the control. In the following example we set the Id property to the *IsCheckedChanged* CommandId Enumaration.

<snippet id='checkbox-commands-xaml'/>

use the following namespace:

```XAML
	xmlns:checkBoxComamnds="clr-namespace:Telerik.XamarinForms.Primitives.CheckBox.Commands;assembly=Telerik.XamarinForms.Primitives"
```

And lets directly handle the needed command in the class and create methods for CanExecute and Execute the IsCheckedChangedCommand.

Here is a quick example:
