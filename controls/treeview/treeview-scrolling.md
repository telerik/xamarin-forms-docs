# Programmatic Scrolling #

RadTreeView exposes the following method for programmatic scrolling to a specific data item: 

* **ScrollItemIntoView(object item)**: Attempts to bring the specified data item into the view.

## Example

Here is a sample definition of the TreeView control:

<snippet id='treeview-programmatic-scrolling-xaml'/>

Inside ScrollItemIntoViewClicked event handler get the concrete item you'd need to navigate to and call **ScrollItemIntoView** method of the TreeView:

<snippet id='treeview-programmaticscrolling-code'/>
	
And the end result:

#### Figure 1: Scrolling item into View
