# ScrollView for Xamarin.Android: Overview

**RadScrollView** is widely based on the traditional Android **ScrollView** component and extends its functionality by introducing support for simultaneously scrolling horizontally and vertically. The component exposes API to control the scrolling behavior whereas three scrolling modes are available:

- Horizontal
- Vertical
- Both

The component preserves the API of the original **ScrollView** as documented on the official Android Documentation website.
