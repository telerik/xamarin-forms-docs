# RadDataGrid Overview #

Most of the data on the Internet is stored in tables within a database. **RadDataGrid** provides the same abstraction over the data â€“ it has Columns and Rows and the intersection of a Row and a Column is called a Cell. When the data from a database is sent to the client, it is usually converted to a Business object (or the so-called ViewModel) where each instance represents a Table Row and each property of the object represents a Column within the original table.
