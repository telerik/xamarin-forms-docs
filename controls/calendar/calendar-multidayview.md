# MultiDay View #

With R3 2018 release RadCalendar comes with new MultiDay view mode which enables you to create a detailed view of the schedule for a specific day (or days). In addition, you will have full control over the way the MultiDay view is visualized through various configuration options such as day start and end times, timeline settings, current time indicator, and more.

The main purpose of the MultiDay view is to display appointments to the end-users in a convenient way. For more details on the Appointments feature of RadCalendar refer to [Appointments]({%slug calendar-appointments%}) topic.
