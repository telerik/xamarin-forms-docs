# Getting Started on Windows

This article should help developers to get started with **Telerik UI for Xamarin** suite on **Windows OS**.

>Please, make sure you have already read the [System Requirements]({% slug system-requirements %}) article before you proceed.

## 1. Start with Xamarin.Forms app

Depending on your scenario, you either have an existing app where you will add our components, or you have to create a new blank app.
 
> If you already have an app, please proceed to the [next step]({%slug getting-started-windows%}#2-getting-the-latest-platform-sdk-versions).

### Create new app from scratch

If you start your app from scratch, you have these options:

- Use our [**Project Wizard**]({%slug project-wizard%}) to create a project that has everything setup for you. You can start using our components right away without manually adding required assemblies and modifying solution files.
- Create a blank Xamarin.Forms app and manually setup all requirements.

> We strongly recommend using the **Project Wizard**. If you choose this option, you can skip the next steps in this article and jump directly to the **Getting Started** section of any control.

If your scenario requires using the other approach, please proceed following the steps in this article.

#### How to create blank Xamarin.Forms app

Create new solution **Xamarin.Forms Portable** / **Shared**

* **Visual Studio**: located at *Templates* > *Visual C#* > *Mobile Apps* section:  
![Create new Xamarin.Forms solution](../images/visual-studio-new-solution.png "Image")
* **Xamarin Studio**: located at *C#* > *Mobile Apps* section:  
![Create new Xamarin.Forms solution](../images/xamarin-studio-new-solution.png "Image")  

Typically, the solution will contain the following projects:

* **Portable/Shared**: Cross platform application library that contains the shared code and UI.
* **Android**: Available on all operation systems.
* **WinPhone**, **Windows 8.1**or **UWP**: Available only for projects created with Visual Studio.
* **iOS**:
 * Available for OS X.
 * If you wish to use Visual Studio as a development environment you will also need a mac machine. You can find more information how to setup your environment here: [Introduction to Xamarin.iOS for Visual Studio](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/getting_started/installation/windows/introduction_to_xamarin_ios_for_visual_studio/)

## 2. Getting the latest platform SDK versions

Make sure that your Xamarin.Forms packages are up to date.

>The **Android project** requires multiple packages with specific versions. The **Xamarin.Forms** package will install most of the required packages as its dependencies. You can then go to [Required Android Support Libraries]({% slug required-android-support-libraries %}) article and check if you have all required files and versions.

This is how you can update the NuGet packages:

1. Right-click the newly created solution and choose: Visual Studio > "Manage NuGet packages for Solution".
2. From Updates >> nuget.org install the latest version of the **Xamarin.Forms** package.

## 3. Add reference to Telerik Components

You have two options.

### Telerik NuGet package server

You can use our [**Telerik NuGet package server**]({%slug telerik-nuget-server%}) to include our suite in your solution and/or update to the latest available version.

### Manually add required assemblies

The hard way is to add all required assemblies manually. We have added a special article in each control section that contains information about all required assemblies. The article is called **"Required Assemblies"** and is located in the **Getting Started** section for each control.

- [Calendar Required Assemblies]({%slug calendar-getting-started-required-assemblies%})
- [Chart Required Assemblies]({%slug chart-getting-started-required-assemblies%})
- [DataForm Required Assemblies]({%slug dataform-getting-started-required-assemblies%})
- [ListView Required Assemblies]({%slug listview-getting-started-required-assemblies%})
- [SideDrawer Required Assemblies]({%slug sidedrawer-getting-started-required-assemblies%})

## 4. Register Renderers (R1 2017 or older only)

If you're using **R1 2017 or older**, you need to register the renderers in the target platform projects (see [Important Changes]({% slug important-changes %}) for more information). These articles will show you how:

- [Calendar Register Renderer]({%slug calendar-getting-started-register-renderer%})
- [Chart Register Renderer]({%slug chart-getting-started-register-renderer%})
- [DataForm Register Renderer]({%slug dataform-getting-started-register-renderer%})
- [ListView Register Renderer]({%slug listview-getting-started-register-renderer%})
- [SideDrawer Register Renderer]({%slug sidedrawer-getting-started--register-renderer%})
