## Color Changing Options

## Stroke Width Customization

The RadCheckBox control exposes a **StrokeWidth** property that specifies the width of the lines with which the Checkbox element is drawn. It affects the outline of the control as well as the check mark.

Here is an example how you can apply a stroke width value:

## CheckBox States

RadCheckBox provides three states â€“ **Checked**, **Unchecked** and **Indeterminate**. The state is controlled through the **IsChecked** property which is of type bool?. The state could be set either through the UI or programmatically as explained below:

* **Checked**/**Unchecked** state - when **IsChecked** is true/false respectively;
* **Indeterminate** state - when **IsChecked** is null;

The default value of **IsChecked** is false.

Here is an example how you can set the **Indeterminate** state:
