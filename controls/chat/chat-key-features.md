# Key Features #

**RadChat** is a Xamarin UI component that can be used for chatbots and chat-based user interfaces. In this topic we will go through the basic properties of the Chat component as well as the key features it provides.

### Basic Setup

RadChat exposes the following properties you could use to setup the component:

* **Author** – represents the current user who sends messages using the Chat UI. This instance determines the messages alignment – incoming messages are placed on the left, outgoing messages - on the right;

* **Message** – defines the current message typed into the input field.

* **Items** collection – contains all the chat items included in the conversation such TextMessages, PickerItems, etc. For more details on the available chat items go to [Chat Items]({% slug chat-items-overview %}) topic.

* **Picker** – defines the ChatPicker that is show as overlay over the messages’ view and could display different pickers in order to provide the end user with a selection of choices. Go to [ChatPicker]({%slug chat-picker-overview %}) topic for more details on the matter.

### MVVM and Commands Support

The Chat control supports data binding through the **ItemsSource** property that can be bound to a collection of any data objects which then have to be converted into chat items.

You could find detailed instructions on how to use the Chat component in a MVVM setup in the [MVVM Support]({%slug chat-mvvm-support %}) and [Commands]({%slug chat-commands%}) topics.
