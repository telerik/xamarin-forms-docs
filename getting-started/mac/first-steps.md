# First Steps

This article will guide you through the basics of __Telerik UI for Xamarin__ and how to start using the suite on __Mac__.

Once you have your first simple Xamarin control up and running, take a look at the __Next Steps__ section to explore other control functionality.

For additional resources you can also review the Related Articles section on the right.

## Download the Controls

When you have an active developer license, you can download the following files:

* Standalone installation
* Assemblies for manual installation
* NuGet packages
* Old versions

>tip Make sure you have already read the [System Requirements]({%slug system-requirements%}#macos) article before you proceed.

Follow the steps below in order to download the installation files:

1. Log into your [Telerik account](https://www.telerik.com/account/) and click on the __Downloads__ tab.

4. Install __Progress Telerik UI for Xamarin__ 
	
	Since MacOS Catalina, downloaded installers and packages are quarantined. If you try to just open the **pkg** file, you may see a popup preventing you from installing it. The easiest solution is to
	1. Right-click on the **.pkg** file you downloaded in Step 3
	2. Select "Open With"
	3. Select "Installer" (see Fig 4a).

5. **Restart Visual Studio for Mac** to complete the installation.
