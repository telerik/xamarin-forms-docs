Once you have installed Telerik UI for Xamarin it's time to create your first application.

## Create a Project with Telerik UI for Xamarin

The easiest way to create a Telerik UI for Xamarin project is to use **Visual Studio Extensions** which are distributed with the Telerik UI for Xamarin installer. They can also be downloaded and installed as separate product from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/). Once installed, the Visual Studio Extensions can be accessed by going to Telerik Menu > Telerik  UI for Xamarin.

>For detailed information on installing the Project Wizard, go to the [Installing VSExtensions]({%slug vs-extensions%}) article.

Depending on your scenario, you either have an existing app where you will add our Telerik components, or you have to create a new blank app. For the purpose of this article we will focus on creating an app from scrath with Visual Studio.

1. Open Microsoft Visual Studio.

2. Create new Telerik Xamarin project.
