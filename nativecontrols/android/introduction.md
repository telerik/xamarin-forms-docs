## Xamarin.Android Wrappers

**Telerik UI for Xamarin** suite includes Xamarin.Android wrappers built on top of truly native Android components. Our Xamarin.Android controls deliver fast loading, excellent drawing capabilities, pixel-perfectness and sleek interactivity on any device and screen-size running Android. The product bridges missing controls and functionalities in the Android native offering including charts, calendar, list and more.

## Controls Overview

Our suite features the following controls for development with Xamarin.Android:

* [AutoComplete]({%slug android-autocomplete-overview%}):  An input control that provides users with suggestions, based on the text or characters they’ve already typed into the search bar. Once the autocomplete shows a list of suggestions, the user can select one or more of them. The control provides means for easy customization and data management.

* [CalendarView]({%slug android-calendar-overview%} "Read more about RadCalendarView for Android"): A calendar control which provides different date representations (in a week, month or year), different selection modes and events integration.

* [ChartView]({%slug android-chart-overview%} "Read more about RadChartView for Android"): A charting control that supports different chart types (and series) organized in hierarchies, depending on the coordinate system, used to plot the data points&mdash;for example Cartesian (**RadCartesianChartView**) and radial (**RadPieChartView**) coordinate systems.

* [DataForm]({%slug android-dataform-overview%} "Read more about RadDataForm for Android"): A control that provides an easy and versatile approach to processing data objects’ public members and building mobile forms fast.

* [DataSource]({%slug android-datasource-overview %} "Read more about RadDataSource for Android"): It is a non-UI control for working with in-memory data which makes it easy for developers to perform sorting, filtering and grouping operations.

* [Gauge]({%slug android-gauges-overview%}): A highly customizable component that allows you to show the current status of a value within a range of upper and lower bounds, illustrate progress towards a goal or a summary of a fluctuating metric.

* [NumberPicker]({%slug android-numberpicker-overview%}): An editing component that allows users to select a number with incremental step adjustments.

* [TabView]({%slug android-tabview-overview%}): Allows developers to create user interfaces similar to the android tab view (view pager and app bar combo) but is a lot easier to use. On top of that, the tabs of RadTabView can be positioned on all four sides of the parent view (typically of the main view). 

* [ListView]({%slug android-listview-overview%} "Read more about RadListView for Android"): A list control which provides popular list features that you will need in you app like: selection, item reordering, loading items on demand, etc.

* [SideDrawer]({%slug android-sidedrawer-overview%} "Read more about RadSideDrawer for Android"): The control is a highly customizable drawer that uses slide-out design pattern and allows developers to embed any content inside the sliding panel from text and icons to sliders and filters. 

* [ScrollView]({%slug android-scrollview-overview %} "Read more about RadScrollView for Android"): A layout container for a view hierarchy that can be scrolled by the user both horizontally and vertically, allowing it to be larger than the physical display.
