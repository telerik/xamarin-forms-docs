## Welcome to Telerik UI for Xamarin

Thank you for choosing Telerik UI for Xamarin.

Telerik UI for Xamarin features Xamarin.Forms controls and Visual Studio item templates for building professional-looking modern mobile applications for Android, iOS and UWP from a single code base. 

In addition to the numerous Xamarin.Forms controls, the suite includes Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS wrappers built on top of truly native iOS and Android components. The Telerik UI for UWP suite is used as basis for the UWP implementation of the controls.

## Help us Improve the Telerik UI for Xamarin Documentation

We believe that the documentation for a product is at its best when the content is a collaboration between the builders and consumers of that product. Everybody can play a role in making our documentation better and we encourage you to help us with that task in the way that you choose:

__Submit a New Issue at GitHub__

If you find an issue with our docs that need to be addressed, the best way to let us know is by creating an issue in our [Github repository](https://github.com/telerik/xamarin-forms-docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue). When creating an issue, please provide a descriptive title, be as specific as possible and link to the documentation in question. If you can provide a link to the closes anchor to the issue, that is even better.

__Update the Documentation at GitHub__

Creating an issue is great, but what we really love are pull requests. This is the most direct method.  So, if you find an issue in the docs, or even feel like creating new content, weâ€™d be happy to have your contributions! The basic steps are that you fork our documentation and submit a pull request. That way you may contribute to exactly where you found the error.  After that, our technical writing team just needs to approve your change request. Please use only standard markdown. For a more detailed instructions, please follow [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/telerik/xamarin-forms-docs/blob/master/README.md) published in GitHub.
